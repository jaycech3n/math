# Research notes

A mix of expositions, research work in progress and notes to self about math and type theory.

Right now there's not so much here that can't already be found in the original citations and on the nLab.
What there is, though, is a slightly idiosyncratic personal touch, an attempt to explain things well, and a curious blend of mathematical and type theoretic language.
