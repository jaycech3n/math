# Research notes

These are my notes on math and type theory.

They contain a mix of expository writing, research work in progress, and frequently incomplete notes-to-self.
Right now there's not so much here that can't already be found in the original citations and on the nLab; what you'll get, though, I hope, is a slightly idiosyncratic personal touch, an attempt to explain things well, and a curious mix of mathematical and type theoretic settings.
