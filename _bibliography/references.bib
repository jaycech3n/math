As corollaries we obtain both decidability of judgmental equality and the injectivity of type constructors.},

In particular, our approach leads to a definition of $\infty$-groupoid internal to type theory and we prove that the type of such $\infty$-groupoids is equivalent to the universe of types. That is, every type admits the structure of an $\infty$-groupoid internally, and this structure is unique.},
