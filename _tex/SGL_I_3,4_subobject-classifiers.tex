\maketitle

We begin with the ur-example.
Recall that in $\Set$, for any $A \subseteq S$ we have
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    A \ar[dr, phantom,
          "\usebox\pullback",
          very near start]
      \ar[d, hook, swap, "i"]
      \ar[r, "!"]             & * \ar[d, hook, "0"] \\
    S \ar[r, swap, "\chi_A"]  & \{0,1\}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where
\[
    \chi_A(s) = \bigg\{
    \begin{aligned}
        & 0 \ \text{if}\ s \in A \\
        & 1 \ \text{otherwise.}
    \end{aligned}
\]
That is, the mono $A \xhookrightarrow{i} S$ is a pullback of the mono $* \xhookrightarrow{0} 2$ along the characteristic function $\chi_A$.
From this we can already extract the ideas for the following two definitions:

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{subobject} of $X$ is an isomorphism class of monos into $X$.
\end{defn}

To elaborate: for any category $\mathcal C$ and $X \in \mathcal C$, the monos into $X$ form a full subcategory $\Mono_{\mathcal C}(X)$ of $\mathcal C/X$.
This is a preorder, so ``being isomorphic'' is a property (not structure).
Such an isomorphism class is a subobject.

\begin{eg}
    In $\Set$, $\{0,1\} \subset \{0,1,2\}$, and the inclusion $i \colon \{0,1\} \hookrightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ witnesses $\{0,1\}$ as a subobject of $\{0,1,2\}$.
    But also the injection
    \[ f \colon \{2,3\} \rightarrowtail \{0,1,2\}, \]
    where $f(2) = 1$, $f(3) = 0$, represents (``is'') the same subobject.
\end{eg}

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{subobject classifier} in a category $\mathcal C$ with terminal $\mathbf 1$ consists of an object $\Omega$ and a mono $\top \colon \mathbf 1 \rightarrow \Omega$,
    such that any mono arises as the pullback of $\top$ along a unique arrow into $\Omega$.
\end{defn}

Explicitly: for any $X \in \mathcal C$ and mono $m \colon S \rightarrowtail X$, there's a unique \emph{characteristic map} $\chi_S \colon X \rightarrow \Omega$ making
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
    S \ar[dr, phantom,
          "\usebox\pullback",
          very near start]
      \ar[d, tail, swap, "m"]
      \ar[r, "!"]             & \mathbf 1 \ar[d, tail, "\top"] \\
    X \ar[r, dashed, swap, "\chi_S"]  & \Omega
\end{tikzcd}
\]
a pullback.

\begin{exercise}
    If $T \rightarrowtail X$ represents the same subobject as $S \rightarrowtail X$ then
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        T \ar[dr, phantom,
            "\usebox\pullback",
            very near start]
        \ar[d, tail]
        \ar[r, "!"]             & \mathbf 1 \ar[d, tail, "\top"] \\
        X \ar[r, dashed, swap, "\chi_S"]  & \Omega
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    is also a pullback square.
    That is, the characteristic map $\chi$ is the same for isomorphic monos.
    This justifies the name ``subobject'' classifier (as opposed to ``mono'' classifier).
\end{exercise}

For every preorder $\lesssim$ we get a partial order by quotienting by
\[ \sim \ \coloneqq \ (\lesssim \cap \gtrsim). \]
Applying this to $\Mono_{\mathcal C}(X)$ gives $\Sub_{\mathcal C}(X)$, the class of subobjects of $X$ (in fact, this is a category, but we won't use this).
So for every object $X$ we have a class $\Sub_{\mathcal C}(X)$ of subobjects of $X$.
This is functorial: for $X \xrightarrow{f} Y$ we have the pullback map
\[ f^* \colon \mathcal C/Y \rightarrow \mathcal C/X \]
which restricts to
\[ f^* \colon \Mono_{\mathcal C}(Y) \rightarrow \Mono_{\mathcal C}(X) \]
(because pullbacks of monos are mono), and which further passes to the quotient
\[ f^* \colon \Sub_{\mathcal C}(Y) \rightarrow \Sub_{\mathcal C}(X), \]
acting via $f^*[g] = [f^*g]$ (one can check that this is well defined).
The upshot is that
\[ \Sub_{\mathcal C} \colon \mathcal C^{op} \rightarrow \Set \]
is a (possibly large) presheaf on $\mathcal C$.

\begin{defn}
    $\mathcal C$ is \emph{well powered} if for all $X \in \mathcal C$, $\Sub_{\mathcal C}(X)$ is small.
\end{defn}

What's the significance of all this to subobject classifiers?
Well, the definition of a subobject classifier as
\begin{quote}
    ``A mono $\mathbf 1 \xrightarrow{\top} \Omega$ (representing a subobject), such that every subobject (represented by) $S \xrightarrow{m} X$ arises uniquely as a pullback of $\top$''     
\end{quote}
amounts to saying that
\[ \hom(X , \Omega) \cong \Sub_{\mathcal C}(X) \]
as classes---and furthermore, by properties of pullback, this isomorphism ends up being natural in $X$.
That is, the (target of the) subobject classifier $\Omega$ is a representing object for the subobject functor.
The converse is also true.

\begin{prop}[Proposition 1, SGL I\S3]
    A locally small category $\mathcal C$ with terminal object and ``enough'' pullbacks has a subobject classifier if and only if
    \[ \Sub_{\mathcal C} \colon \mathcal C^{op} \rightarrow \Set \]
    is representable.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    In meeting. Maybe I'll type it up later.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    A locally small category with subobject classifier is well powered.\footnote{i.e.\ each object has set-many subobjects, which I think means (later) that the power object is nice and can be defined.}
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
    Subobject classifiers are unique up to isomorphism.
\end{corollary}
