<p>A mix of expositions, research work in progress and notes to self about math and type theory.</p>

<p>Right now thereâ€™s not so much here that canâ€™t already be found in the original citations and on the nLab.
What there is, though, is a slightly idiosyncratic personal touch, an attempt to explain things well, and a curious blend of mathematical and type theoretic language.</p>
