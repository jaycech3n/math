<p>These are my notes on math and type theory.</p>

<p>They contain a mix of expository writing, research work in progress, and frequently incomplete notes-to-self.
Right now thereâ€™s not so much here that canâ€™t already be found in the original citations and on the nLab; what youâ€™ll get, though, I hope, is a slightly idiosyncratic personal touch, an attempt to explain things well, and a curious mix of mathematical and type theoretic settings.</p>
